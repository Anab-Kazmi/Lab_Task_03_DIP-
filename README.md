Prompt:

"Write a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib in Google Colab to perform histogram and contrast enhancement on a colored image uploaded by the user. The program should do the following step by step:
Allow the user to upload any image.
Display the original image.
Apply built-in histogram equalization on the image (use Y channel for color images) and display the result.
Implement manual histogram equalization for grayscale images, display the result, and plot its histogram alongside the original histogram.
Apply contrast stretching to the grayscale version and display the result.
Apply logarithmic transformation and display the result.
Apply gamma transformation (allow user to set gamma) and display the result.
Display all transformations (Original Grayscale, Contrast Stretching, Log Transform, Gamma Transform) side by side in a single figure with proper titles and axes turned off.
Ensure the code is well-structured, modular, and compatible with Google Colab, and each step is clearly labeled."
